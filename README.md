# MyFirstRepository

I'm going to create a wether forecast website using bootstrap, JQuery and some apis, this small project is just for my csci571 homework, hope I'll learn new knowledge through this project.

You can have a look at my website at: http://cs-server.usc.edu:39190/MyFirstRepository/index.html
